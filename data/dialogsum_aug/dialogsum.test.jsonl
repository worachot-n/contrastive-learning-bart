This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \n#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax.

Look at my running shoes over there.\n#Person1#: Andrew. They're still in the box. \n#Person2#: Well ... \n#Person1#: Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful. It's great, but you also need to learn how to eat right. For example, you need to eat smaller portions. And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\n#Person2#: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\n#Person1#: Andrew!

Don't eat late at night.\n#Person2#:  What? Like what?\n#Person1#:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat.

It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \n#Person2#:  Oh, well. \n#Person1#: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\n#Person2#: I don't drink five gallons.\n#Person1#: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups!

This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

No wonder you ended up easy prey.\n#Person1#: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\n#Person2#: of course, that's something really irritating.

The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents.\n#Person1#: Pilgrimages are common in many faiths.\n#Person2#: Yes. In England, Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages.\n#Person1#: Isn't there a place in france where people go to get healed?\n#Person2#: I think that place is Lourdes.

First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? \n#Person2#: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. \n#Person1#: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \n#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? \n#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. \n#Person1#: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. \n#Person2#: No problem!
